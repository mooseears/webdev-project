My plan is to have the site be all on one page. There will be a navbar at the top with buttons for 
each section of the site. Clicking on them should change the lower section to the relevant content.

One of the things I wanted to do was have my projects page dynamically populated based on folders
for each project, but I couldn't figure out a way to read the info from a text file without setting 
up a server. So I just hard-coded everything into an array and used that.
