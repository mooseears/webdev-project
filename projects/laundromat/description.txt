This project is a simple laundromat scene created for a class I took at PCC. Our assignment was to build a space in Unity using what we had learned at the time. I chose to make a laundromat because I thought it an interesting space with good options for including sound effects. For some added interaction, the carts and detergent bottles are all rigid body objects that can be knocked around with the hand attached to the player camera.
