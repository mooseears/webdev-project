My final project for a gamedev class I took a while ago was a puzzle game called Adoption Rush, made in an old version of Game Maker. Our assignment was to make a game related to a non-profit of our choosing and I chose the Oregon Humane Society. The Oregon Humane Society had a yearly goal of 10,000 adoptions, so I made a game geared toward that.
