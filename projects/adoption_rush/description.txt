My final project for a gamedev class I took a while ago was a puzzle game called Adoption Rush, made in an old version of Game Maker. Our assignment was to make a game related to a non-profit of our choosing and I chose the Oregon Humane Society. The Oregon Humane Society had a yearly goal of 10,000 adoptions, so I made a game geared toward that.

The game involves matching people tiles with sets of animal print tiles. Each match must start with a person and then include one or more animal tiles of the same color. Each additional tile in a match increases the score received for that match. The selected tiles then fall from the game board and new ones come in from above. Players are given the option of different game lengths and the highest score is recorded for each one.ADOPTION RUSH INFOR BLAHGFDSDBNKASHWASIHDFKNSDFKNSDFHIKDFSA
